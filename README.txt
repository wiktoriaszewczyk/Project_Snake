"This Snake Game project in C++ is a classic game that is easy to understand and enjoyable to play. This project gives players a sense of accomplishment when they reach higher levels. The code includes various functions and classes, such as a snake class that can be used to move the snake and a board class for creating the gameâ€™s playing field. The Snake game will be developed using open-source C++ libraries such as conio and various components such as classes, functions, and loops. As the level of the game increases, Object-Oriented Programming will be applied to make a more efficient coding architecture.

Technologies Required: C++ programming language, Object Oriented Programming (OOPS), Data Structures & Algorithms, Multithreading & Processes, Keyboard & Mouse Events, Timers & Clock." (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-50-cpp-project-ideas-for-beginners-advanced/)
